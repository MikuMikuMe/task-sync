Creating a comprehensive task-sync program requires integrating with various platform APIs, handling authentication, syncing tasks, and managing conflicts. Below is a simplified Python example demonstrating a basic structure for a task management system that could potentially sync with multiple services like Google Tasks, Trello, or Asana. This example uses placeholder implementations for API interactions and focuses on structure and error handling.

To keep it simple and platform-agnostic, we'll define a base class for task services, simulate a few tasks, and provide a skeleton for syncing tasks between two hypothetical services. Here's a basic implementation:

```python
import json
import logging
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Dict

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Exception for sync errors
class SyncError(Exception):
    pass

# A data structure to represent a task
class Task:
    def __init__(self, task_id: str, name: str, completed: bool, due_date: datetime):
        self.task_id = task_id
        self.name = name
        self.completed = completed
        self.due_date = due_date

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Task({self.task_id}, {self.name}, {self.completed}, {self.due_date})"
    
    def to_dict(self):
        return {
            "task_id": self.task_id,
            "name": self.name,
            "completed": self.completed,
            "due_date": self.due_date.isoformat()
        }

# Base class for a task service
class TaskServiceBase:
    def __init__(self, service_name: str):
        self.service_name = service_name

    def fetch_tasks(self) -> List[Task]:
        raise NotImplementedError("This method needs to be overridden by subclasses.")

    def update_task(self, task: Task) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError("This method needs to be overridden by subclasses.")

    def add_task(self, task: Task) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError("This method needs to be overridden by subclasses.")

# Example implementation of a task service
class MockTaskService(TaskServiceBase):
    def __init__(self, service_name: str):
        super().__init__(service_name)
        self.tasks = [
            Task('1', 'Task 1', False, datetime(2023, 10, 1)),
            Task('2', 'Task 2', True, datetime(2023, 10, 5)),
        ]

    def fetch_tasks(self) -> List[Task]:
        logging.info(f"Fetching tasks from {self.service_name}.")
        return self.tasks

    def update_task(self, task: Task) -> None:
        logging.info(f"Updating task {task.task_id} in {self.service_name}.")
        # Simulate an update
        for i, t in enumerate(self.tasks):
            if t.task_id == task.task_id:
                self.tasks[i] = task
                return
        raise SyncError(f"Task {task.task_id} not found in {self.service_name}.")

    def add_task(self, task: Task) -> None:
        logging.info(f"Adding task {task.task_id} to {self.service_name}.")
        self.tasks.append(task)

# Function to sync tasks between two services
def sync_tasks(service1: TaskServiceBase, service2: TaskServiceBase):
    try:
        logging.info("Starting task synchronization process.")
        tasks1 = {task.task_id: task for task in service1.fetch_tasks()}
        tasks2 = {task.task_id: task for task in service2.fetch_tasks()}

        # Compare and sync tasks from service1 to service2
        for task_id, task1 in tasks1.items():
            if task_id in tasks2:
                task2 = tasks2[task_id]
                # Sync logic could be more sophisticated based on timestamps or priorities
                if task1.completed != task2.completed:
                    logging.info(f"Syncing completion status for task {task_id}.")
                    service2.update_task(task1)  # Update service2 to match service1
            else:
                logging.info(f"Task {task_id} missing in {service2.service_name}, adding it.")
                service2.add_task(task1)

        # (Additional step: sync service2 to service1 if needed)

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred during synchronization: {e}")
        raise

# Main function to demonstrate the synchronization
def main():
    try:
        service1 = MockTaskService("Mock Service 1")
        service2 = MockTaskService("Mock Service 2")
        
        logging.info("Initial tasks in Service 1:")
        logging.info(json.dumps([task.to_dict() for task in service1.fetch_tasks()], indent=2))
        
        logging.info("Initial tasks in Service 2:")
        logging.info(json.dumps([task.to_dict() for task in service2.fetch_tasks()], indent=2))

        sync_tasks(service1, service2)

        logging.info("Tasks in Service 1 after sync:")
        logging.info(json.dumps([task.to_dict() for task in service1.fetch_tasks()], indent=2))

        logging.info("Tasks in Service 2 after sync:")
        logging.info(json.dumps([task.to_dict() for task in service2.fetch_tasks()], indent=2))

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error in main function: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation:
- **Task Class**: Defines a simple structure for tasks with properties and a method to convert a task to a dictionary for easy JSON serialization.
- **Task Service Base**: An abstract class providing a blueprint for task services with methods to fetch, update, and add tasks.
- **Mock Task Service**: A mock implementation of the task service for testing purposes, including basic in-memory task storage.
- **Sync Function**: Compares tasks between two services and updates/creates tasks on `service2` to reflect the state in `service1`. Extensible logic could be added for more sophisticated syncing strategies.
- **Main Function**: Sets up two mock services and runs the sync process between them, logging the state of tasks before and after the sync.

This example program sets up the necessary structures and error handling for extending the functionality to work with real APIs like Google Tasks, Trello, or Asana by implementing service-specific subclasses replacing the `MockTaskService`.
